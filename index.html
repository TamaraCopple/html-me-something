    <p>  Now on my third major career shift and with more hobbies than I have time to pursue. If you want to keep up, put on your running shoes because even Mother Nature has to work pretty hard to slow me down.</p>

    <h2>Women in Tech Evangelist by Night</h2>
    <p>I have been the co-director for the for <a href="http://kcwomenintech.org/">Kansas City Women in Technology's</a> adult coding introduction, <a href="http://codingandcocktails.kcwomenintech.org">Coding &amp; Cocktails since mid-2015.</a> I attended the very first session of Coding &amp; Cocktails in April 2015 at the encouragement of my husband; but it was the supportive and fun atmosphere, not to mention the raw enthuiastic energy of the program's organizers that hooked me.  After that first session, I volunteered to help coordinate future programs and have not looked back since.</p>

    Coding &amp; Cocktails is about overcoming your inhibitions and self-doubt and trying something radically different. Despite the name, drinking alcohol is not required, but if a custom cocktail helps relax you enough to give it a try, we’re your show. If you discover programming is not your thing, that’s okay. Enjoy the drinks, enjoy the camaraderie, and pat yourself on the back for at least giving it a try. You’ve already done more than most.

<h2>. . . RPG Gamer in between!</h2>
<p>Although I have played in Serenity, In Nomine, and Dresden RPG's Dungeons and Dragons is my default RPG of choice. I have played almost every character class at least once, run a 5-year homebrew campaign of my own creation, and am currently running the WOTC module <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/hoard-dragon-queen">Hoard of the Dragon Queen</a>. Admittedly it's a compromise - as busy as the rest of life keeps me, I had to compromise somewhere and modules take the work of imagining a world, plot line and encounters and do it all for me so that I can concentrate on having as much fun running as my players do playing.</p>
